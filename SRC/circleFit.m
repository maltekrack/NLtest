% This function implements the well-known Circle Fit method for estimating
% frequency and damping ratio of a well-separated mode from the
% corresponding section of the frequency response function (FRF), see 
% e.g. [1].
% 
% The particular implementation is intended for Response Controlled 
% Testing of nonlinear structures, where the FRF has been acquired within a
% narrow frequency band around the resonance, possibly using
% phase control. In such a case, the common frequency spacing technique for
% estimating the natural frequency might not be useful, because the
% frequency window is so narrow and control imperfections spoil the quality
% of the FRF (as compared to that obtained with a common FRF estimator 
% applied to data acquired under random broadband testing in the linear 
% regime). Instead, the natural frequency is simply obtained as the phase 
% resonant point of the (centralized) FRF. This assumes 
% that the FRF is of appropriate type, e.g. receptance, and the mode is
% sufficiently real!
