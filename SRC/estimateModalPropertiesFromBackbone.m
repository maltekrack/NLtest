% DESCRIPTION: 
% Matlab function estimating modal properties (frequency, damping ratio and
% (mass-normalized) mode shape. 
% To this end, the Fourier coefficient of the response must be given in 
% terms of displacement. Furthermore, the Fourier coefficients are turned 
% such that the fundamental harmonic component of a specific sensor is 
% purely real. Thus, the index of this sensor must be provided, e.g. the 
% drive point.
%
% Three versions are implemented: for force excitation (following [1] and  
% for base excitation in the model-free or the modal-based version [2].
%
% For force excitation, linear mass-normalized mode shapes are 
% required. Note that the number of linear modes included in the mode 
% shapes must not exceed the number of sensors (nSens >= nModes). The 
% sensor order in the linear mode shapes must be the same as in the 
% response Fourier coefficients. The index of the sensor to be purely real
% must be the drive point.
%
% In the model-free version for base excitation, a quadrature rule is 
% suggested to estimate the damping ration according to Eq. 28 in [2]. To
% this end, the weights must be provided. If linear mass-normalized mode
% shapes are further provided (optional), the nonlinear mode shape is 
% also mass-normalized as in the force excitation case.
%
% In the model-based version for base excitation, linearPhi^H*M*b must be 
% provided as well as linear mass-normalized mode shapes. Note that the 
% number of linear modes included in the mode  shapes must not exceed the 
% number of sensors (nSens >= nModes).
