% This script post-processes data acquired during Excitation Controlled 
% Testing of the benchmark system of the Tribomechadynamics Research
% Challenge. In the tests, the set value of the phase lag between response 
% and excitation was stepped, while the excitation level was kept fixed,
% using feedback control.
% 
% The challenge is described in [1]. The tests were part of Project 3 of 
% the Tribomechadynamics Research Camp 2022 in Stuttgart [2]. The test 
% methods are described in [3]. CAD models, technical drawings and design 
% documentation are available in [4].
% 
% In this script, one selects 1 out of 4 configurations and specifies a
% tested excitation level. This script then post-processes the 
% corresponding data and generates a figure similar to Figure 11 in [3].
% 
% The corresponding data has to be available in the BASEFOLDER specified 
% by the user. The data can be downloaded from [5]. For information on the 
% data file names and content structure, see README in [5].
